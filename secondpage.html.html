        <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most
        recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator,
        primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social
        predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of
        its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave
        their mother's home range to establish their own.

        The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in the
        south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger
        populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia,
        from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today's tiger range
        is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian
        subcontinent and Sumatra.

        The tiger is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was
        estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the
        20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other. Major reasons
        for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. This, coupled with the
        fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with
        humans.

        The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured
        prominently in ancient mythology and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature,
        appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of
        India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.</p>
