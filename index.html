    <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domestic</a>
        <!--anchor link, href hyperlink reference, https... location of my file https stands for hyper text transfer protocol secure-->
        species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated
        species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild
        members of the family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely
        and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt
        rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]

        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp
        teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well
        developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and
        grunting as well as cat-specific body language. It is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds
        too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It is a
        predator that is most active at dawn and dusk.[7] It secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]

        Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to
        five kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat
        fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets,
        resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and
        reptile species, and evoking population control.[10]

        Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC.[11] It was long thought that cat domestication was
        initiated in Ancient Egypt, as since around 3100 BC veneration was given to cats in ancient Egypt.[12][13]

        As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States by number of pets owned, after
        freshwater fish,[14] with 95 million cats owned.[15][16] In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in
        more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.[17]</p>

    <h2>Etymology and naming</h2>
    <!--heading, heading size 1, heading size 2, heading size 3, heading size 4, heading size 5, heading size 6 -->
    <p>The origin of the English word 'cat', Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was
        first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[18] It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from an
        Egyptian precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, "tomcat", or its feminine form suffixed with -t.[19] The Late Latin word
        is also thought to be derived from Afro-Asiatic languages.[20] The Nubian word kaddîska "wildcat" and Nobiin
        kadīs are possible sources or cognates.[21] The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic قَطّ‎ qaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ. It
        is "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to
        Greek and to Syriac and Arabic".[22] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and
        ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gáđfi, "female stoat", and Hungarian hölgy, "stoat"; from
        Proto-Uralic *käďwä, "female (of a furred animal)".[23]

        The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced
        from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar
        forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may
        have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.[24][25]

        A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[26] (or a gib,[27] if neutered) An unspayed female is called a queen,[28]
        especially in a cat-breeding context. A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, the
        word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[29] A group of cats can be referred to as a
        clowder or a glaring.[30]</p>

    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <h3>Main article: Cat evolution</h3>
    <p>The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent">common ancestor</a>  about 10–15 million years
        ago.[38] The genus Felis diverged from the Felidae around 6–7 million years ago.[39] Results of phylogenetic
        research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the
        domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[40] The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are
        both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes[41] and roughly 20,000 genes.[42] The leopard cat
        (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC. This line of partially domesticated
        cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.[43]</p>

    <h2>Robot</h2>
    <p>A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer— capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.[2] Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed on the lines of human form, but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to their aesthetics.

        Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence or thought of its own. Autonomous things are expected to proliferate in the coming decade,[3] with home robotics and the autonomous car as some of the main drivers.[4]
        
        The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,[5] as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing is robotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics: soft robotics.
        
        From the time of ancient civilization there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and even automata resembling animals and humans, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through the Industrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wireless remote-control.
        
        The term comes from a Slavic root, robot-, with meanings associated with labor. The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920 Czech-language play R.U.R. (Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti - Rossum's Universal Robots) by Karel Čapek, though it was Karel's brother Josef Čapek who was the word's true inventor.[6][7][8] Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created by William Grey Walter in Bristol, England in 1948, as well as Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s by John T. Parsons and Frank L. Stulen. The first commercial, digital and programmable robot was built by George Devol in 1954 and was named the Unimate. It was sold to General Motors in 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal from die casting machines at the Inland Fisher Guide Plant in the West Trenton section of Ewing Township, New Jersey.[9]
        
        Robots have replaced humans[10] in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for rising technological unemployment as they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions.[11] The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future.</p>
